          just edvelopment, but in every aspect of any business.

          As a developer, you have everything availabke to you and all that's
          holding you back is yourself
        </p>
        <p>A quote I live perfectly illustrates what I mean</p>
        <p>
          "How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?" You've
          already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time te
          elevate your skills and beome a leader in something you're passionate
          about.
